## Game Mechanics

### Racing Algorithm

The racing simulation employs a multi-factor algorithm considering:

1. **Base Speed Calculation**
   ```javascript
   baseSpeed = Math.random() * 2 + 1  // Range: 1-3 units/frame
   ```

2. **Environmental Factors**
   - Obstacle collision penalties
   - Track surface variations
   - Entity-specific performance modifiers

3. **Collision Detection**
   - Euclidean distance calculation for obstacle proximity
   - Temporary speed reduction upon collision
   - Recovery time implementation

### Probability Model

The odds calculation system utilizes:

```javascript
odds = 1.5 + (entityId / 11) * 2  // Range: 1.68x - 3.5x
```

This model provides higher-numbered entities with marginally better odds, introducing strategic considerations for users.

### State Management

The application maintains comprehensive state information:

- **Game State**: Current race status, entity positions, timing data
- **User State**: Virtual currency balance, prediction history, preferences
- **Visual State**: Camera position, animation settings, UI element states

## Implementation Details

### Core Classes and Functions

#### BallRacingGame Class

The primary controller class managing:
- Canvas rendering and animation loops
- Entity physics and movement calculations
- User interface event handling

#### Key Algorithms

1. **Rendering Pipeline**
   ```javascript
   gameLoop() {
       this.updateRace();    // Physics calculations
       this.render();        // Visual rendering
       requestAnimationFrame(() => this.gameLoop());
   }
   ```

2. **Collision Detection**
   ```javascript
   checkObstacleCollisions(entity) {
       const distance = Math.sqrt(
           Math.pow(entity.x - obstacle.x, 2) + 
           Math.pow(entity.y - obstacle.y, 2)
       );
       return distance < collisionThreshold;
   }
   ```
