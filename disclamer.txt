═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2: GAMBLING SIMULATION DISCLAIMER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

2.1 VIRTUAL CURRENCY SYSTEM
All monetary representations within this Software utilize exclusively virtual currency units that possess no real-world monetary value, legal tender status, or convertibility to actual currency. These virtual units serve solely as numerical representations for gameplay mechanics and user interface demonstration.

2.2 SIMULATION PARAMETERS
The betting mechanisms, odds calculations, probability distributions, and financial outcomes are entirely simulated through mathematical algorithms. These simulations do not represent, predict, or correlate with real-world gambling scenarios, financial markets, or actual betting outcomes.

2.3 NO REAL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
Users cannot, under any circumstances:
- Deposit real money, cryptocurrency, or financial instruments
- Withdraw virtual currency for real-world value
- Exchange virtual currency for goods or services
- Transfer virtual currency between users or external systems
- Convert virtual currency to legal tender or digital assets

2.4 ALGORITHMIC OUTCOME DETERMINATION
All race results, betting outcomes, and virtual currency fluctuations are determined by predetermined mathematical algorithms implemented within the Software. These algorithms utilize pseudo-random number generation techniques that may not reflect real-world probability distributions or gambling scenarios.

2.5 PROBABILITY AND FAIRNESS CONSIDERATIONS
The Software implements simplified probability models for demonstration purposes. These models do not represent statistically accurate gambling odds, house edge calculations, or professionally calibrated gaming algorithms used in regulated gambling environments.
